abstract="We classify the almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions in dimensions 4 and 5 up to affine and CCZ equivalence using backtrack programming and give a partial model for the complexity of such a search. In particular, we demonstrate that up to dimension 5 any APN function is CCZ equivalent to a power function, while it is well known that in dimensions 4 and 5 there exist APN functions which are not extended affine (EA) equivalent to any power function. We further calculate the total number of APN functions up to dimension 5 and present a new CCZ equivalence class of APN functions in dimension 6.",

abstract="Block ciphers are arguably the most important cryptographic primitive in practice. While their security against mathematical attacks is rather well understood, physical threats such as side-channel analysis (SCA) still pose a major challenge for their security. An effective countermeasure to thwart SCA is using a cipher representation that applies the threshold implementation (TI) concept. However, there are hardly any results available on how this concept can be adopted for block ciphers with large (i.e., 8-bit) Sboxes. In this work we provide a systematic analysis on and search for 8-bit Sbox constructions that can intrinsically feature the TI concept, while still providing high resistance against cryptanalysis. Our study includes investigations on Sboxes constructed from smaller ones using Feistel, SPN, or MISTY network structures. As a result, we present a set of new Sboxes that not only provide strong cryptographic criteria, but are also optimized for TI. We believe that our results will find an inspiring basis for further research on high-security block ciphers that intrinsically feature protection against physical attacks.",

abstract="The purpose of this paper is to show that there exist DES-like iterated ciphers, which are provably resistant against differential attacks. The main result on the security of a DES-like cipher with independent round keys is Theorem 1, which gives an upper bound to the probability of r-round differentials, as defined in [3] and this upper bound depends only on the round function of the iterated cipher. Moreover, it is shown that there exist functions such that the probabilities of differentials are less than or equal to 22 âˆ’ nwhere n is the length of the plaintext block. We also show a prototype of an iterated block cipher, which is compatible with DES and has proven security against differential attacks.",
