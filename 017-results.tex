\subsection{Dimension $n=1$}
In dimension $n=1$ we have only a single EA equivalence class, see \autoref{tab:dim1}.  It contains all four functions, including the two bijective functions. All functions are linear, and have the same Walsh spectrum (\autoref{tab:walshdim1}).

\subsection{Dimension $n=2$}
In dimension $n=2$ we have two EA equivalence classes, one containing the bijective functions, see \autoref{tab:dim2}. They have distinct Walsh spectrums (\autoref{tab:walshdim2}) and thus are also different CCZ equivalence classes.

\subsection{Dimension $n=3$}
In dimension $n=3$, we have seven distinct EA equivalence classes, four containing bijective functions (and these are all linear or quadratic), see \autoref{tab:dim3}.  They all have distinct Walsh spectrums (\autoref{tab:walshdim3}), and thus also represent different CCZ equivalence classes.

\subsection{Dimension $n=4$}
In dimension $n=4$, we find 4713 different EA equivalence classes (with 71 different sizes), of which 194 contain bijective functions (while 4519 do not), see \autoref{tab:dim4}. The classes have 481 distinct Walsh spectrums (\autoref{tab:walshdim4}). However, the number of CCZ equivalence classes is 4151 and thus much larger (only 562 EA canonical representatives are not also CCZ canonical representatives).
